Images which belong to different classes should be stored in separate directories. The file names
are not important. All directories should be placed under one root directory like in the schema below:

```bash
├── images
    ├── class_1
    |   ├── image_1.jpg
    |   ...
    |   └── image_n.jpg
    ├── class_2
    |   ├── image_1.jpg
    |   ...
    |   └── image_n.jpg
    |   ...
